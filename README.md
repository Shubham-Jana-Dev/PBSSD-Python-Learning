# 🐍 PBSSD Python Programming Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This project documents my progress in the **Paschim Banga Society for Skill Development (PBSSD)** Python Programming course. Here, I store my daily notes, practice scripts, and logic-building exercises.

## 🗓️ Day 01: The Foundations of Python
**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**Focus:** Development Environments, Dynamic Typing, and Memory Management.

### 1. Understanding the Environment
Python provides a built-in tool called **IDLE** (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) which I explored today:
* **Interactive Shell:** Used for quick testing and arithmetic operations.
* **Script Mode (Editor):** Used for writing permanent programs and saving them as `.py` files.
* **PVM (Python Virtual Machine):** The internal engine that executes the source code we write.

### 2. Key Technical Concepts
During the session, I practiced several core Python features:

#### 🔹 Dynamic Typing
Python identifies data types automatically at runtime. I used the `type()` function to verify different classes:
- `int`: Whole numbers (e.g., 19)
- `str`: Text/Strings (e.g., "Shubham Jana")
- `float`: Decimal values (e.g., 2.3)
- `list`: Ordered collections (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

#### 🔹 Memory Management (`id`)
Every value in Python is an object stored in memory. I used the `id()` function to fetch the unique memory address (Hash Address) of various objects.

#### 🔹 Reserved Keywords
I learned how to use the `keyword` module to list all words reserved by the Python language for specific logic.
