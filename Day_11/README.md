# 🗓️ Day 11: Loops and Iterative Logic

**Topic:** Mastering the `while` loop and Range-based problem solving.

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered
* **Iterative Statements:** Learned how to execute blocks of code repeatedly based on a condition.
* **The `while` Loop:** Used for scenarios where the exact number of iterations is not known in advance.
* **Loop Control:** Managing the **Initialization**, **Condition**, and **Update** (Increment/Decrement) to avoid infinite loops.

---

## 📝 Practical Assignments
Today's folder contains scripts focused on categorizing and analyzing number ranges:
* **Assignment_day11.py**: Logic for iterating through a user-defined range and performing calculations.
* **Range Analysis**: Implementing logic to count even/odd numbers and maintain a running sum within a loop.

## 💡 Engineering Observation
In `while` loops, the **Update Statement** is critical. Forgetting to increment or decrement the counter results in a crash of the runtime environment due to an infinite loop.
